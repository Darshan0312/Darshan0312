- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Darshan BR üëã
- üëÄ I‚Äôm deeply interested in the exciting fields of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently immersed in learning the intricacies of **Agentic AI with Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and advancing my knowledge in **Deep Learning**. I'm particularly exploring areas like:
    - **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Including models such as those from Hugging Face (e.g., Phi, Qwen, DeepSeek), fine-tuning techniques, and deployment with tools like Ollama and LM Studio.
    - **Vector Databases:** With experience exploring LanceDB and Qdrant for efficient data retrieval.
    - **Agentic Frameworks:** Currently focusing on developing intelligent agents using frameworks like Langchain and potentially exploring others like CrewAI and LangGraph.
    - **Deep Learning Techniques:** Hands-on learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow.
    - **Multimodal AI:** With an interest in models that process both text and images.
    - **Speech Technologies:** Including Text-to-Speech (TTS) models (like Coqui TTS, VOSK) and Speech-to-Text (STT) models.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm actively seeking opportunities in the **ML and AI domains**. I'm eager to contribute my growing skills to innovative projects and collaborate with experienced professionals.
